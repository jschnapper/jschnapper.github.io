			<div class="text">
			Pea is a speculative design concept created by Clara Park, Jarrod Schnapper, Rudy Venguswamy, and Cindy Yuan. It is a commentary on the current trend of technology and how we are incredibly dependent on both physical and digital products. The augmented reality personal assistant wearable, Pea, has many features based on current technology, but blown out of proportion in a style that we believe could happen if we continue on this dependent path.

			Below is a description of the features of Pea with their connections to current technology.

	<div class="first-column">
		<div class="about-most-subhead"> NAVIGATION </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze </p>

			<p> Pea:  We’re so dependent on Google Maps that the days of navigation using a paper map or needing to ask for directions are gone. We took this to the extreme and wanted to provide navigation for people indoors while micromanaging their movements to an absurd level. We are demonstrating how we are very reliant on and trustworthy of these navigational tools. There are examples in the news of people following directions provided by these navigation software even though they are obviously erroneous, such as when they indicate to take a road which may actually be a lake. Pea’s navigational tool is depicted in a world where we need directions everywhere and where the display is always in front of our eyes, coddling and encouraging this dependency while decreasing interactions with actual people. </p>

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> SOCIAL MEDIA </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: UNNUM, Mailchimp, Facebook (for pages), Audiense, </p>

			<p> Pea: There is a host of Software as a Service (SaaS) products that help businesses and celebrities manage their social media presence, providing them with guidance on what to post and when to post, and detailing the data analytics of user engagement. With Pea, we wanted to intelligently take pictures for the user and post them to social media by incorporating the services provided by these SaaS companies. We believe that one main purpose of social media is self-expression, but by using all of these algorithms to post for users, the personal aspect of social media is being dismissed. Pea takes it further by not just telling users when to post, but by taking the pictures for users and posting the captions for the content too. In doing so, the user is completely removed from the process to receive “maximum engagement” at the cost of individuality and personality. </p>

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> CONVERSATIONS </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: Autocorrect, Facebook M </p>

			<p>Pea: Over time, autocorrect from Apple’s messenger learns what you say. Based on what you previously typed, it will make suggestions what you would probably say next in order to increase your typing efficiency. Facebook has recently unveiled “M,” which is similar because it will use what you say and encourage response using a sticker as well as make certain suggestions (like a personal assistant) -- Facebook intends to roll out more features in the future. Pea takes this concept further by incorporating suggestions into actual conversations. It uses facial recognition to know who you’re talking to search through your history of conversations (as well as online profiles) to suggest what users should say. With this feature, it removes the necessity of remembering facts about anyone as the product will remember and -- essentially -- talk for you. </p>

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> HEALTH MANAGER </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: Fitbit, Apple Watch, other wearables </p>

			<p> Pea:  We are depending on these health managers to improve our lifestyle and overall health, which is a great use of technology. Pea, however, brings it to the next level by automatically micromanaging every aspect of your life to increase your health, such as telling users when to eat, when to sleep, when to use the bathroom, etc. This demonstrates a loss of independence and lack of willpower as result of -- what some would say -- invasive technology.

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> PRODUCT EYE TRACKER </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: Google, Amazon, and product ad on the internet </p> 


			<p> Pea: Anywhere you go on the internet, your search patterns, mouse clicks, pauses, and movements are monitored by sophisticated algorithms that are trying to convince you to click through on one of their ads. Websites collect cookies to learn more about the consumer to better target their messages to them. With Product Eye Tracking, Pea monitors people’s eye movements to determine what you consciously and subconsciously desire. Pea will notice this and then make personal suggestions to you in real time, anywhere. Receive personalized ads just for you. This feature emphasizes the commercialization of life and how companies are using users data all the time in order to predict and encourage user to buy certain products tailored to them. The potential for invasiveness is great. </p>

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> PERSONAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: Facebook friends and any social media site where you can block people </p> 

			<p> Pea: On Facebook, we have so many tools at our disposal to manage our friends, ranging from the acquaintance to friend to block option. Pea moves this virtual concept into a physical space. The technology allows you to avoid people you don’t want to see, which may seem cool in theory, but as a form of social interaction, it means we are encouraging people to avoid their problems and not solve them. To allow for online behavior to permeate into real interactions in this way would open the flood gates for more of these actions to occur in real life. </p>

		<div class="about-most-subhead"> SECURITY </div>
			<div class="text">
			<p> Current Technology: NSA Surveillance </p> 

			<p> Pea: There have been many concerns over the years with the NSA’s big data surveillance of US citizens to stop crime. Pea plays on these concerns and takes devices that people are wearing and brings them into the surveillance scope. Each person, by acting as a security camera and having face to face conversations monitored gives up an even larger degree of privacy in order to have an assistant that helps them with their private in real life matters. </p>
