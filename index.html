								<div class="feature-description">
									Pea’s state of the art micro-navigation™ software understands the layout of the room you’re in by pulling up floor plans and analyzing the building as you walk through it! Based on this information, Pea provides you with pinpoint directions that help you move around objects in a room, find ways around people, or even look up the nearest restroom. Never get lost again, bump into those pesky coffee tables, and never have to embarrassingly ask for directions to the loo!

								<div class="feature-description">
								Ever wish someone told you when you were looking at something “picture perfect”? With Pea, your virtual assistant analyzes everything that you see and takes a snapshot of the moment for you to be posted on social media at the perfect time. Rather than slaving away in front of Facebook or Instagram trying to figure out the best filter or which picture to post, Pea does it all for you, leaving you free to explore your world and connect with it!

								<div class="feature-description">
								Calling all awkward folk in the room! Talking on social media is easy since you have time to think about your response and have all these bots to help you do it. Now every conversation has to be well-thought out and interesting. It’s impossible to achieve practically in real life! But now, thanks to Pea, you can have real-time support for every conversation you have, with the backing of Artificial Intelligence and smart conversation-option generation to help guide you through even the most tough or awkward conversations.

							<div class="feature-overlay">
								<div class="feature-description">
								Ever download a fitness app and get too lazy to actually use it? It’s not your fault! Fitness apps need you to put time into them to help you stay healthy, but with Pea, our computer vision from the glasses deals with all of the data input on its own. Never spend time doing all that boring stuff again! Our health manager application pays attention to your habits and comes up with suggestions as you go through life for you to improve your health and manage your wellbeing effectively, from taking the long way to work, to going to the restroom on time.

								We all know you had your eyes on those skateboards they were carrying! Why doesn’t Amazon? Thanks to our eye tracking software, Pea can detect when you’re paying attention to the products you see on people. Our software figures out what they’re wearing and finds the right fit for you online. Now, everyone is a fashion model in public and a billboard for the brands they rep!

								Isn’t it so awkward how you always run into the people you really want to avoid? Say no more! Thanks to Pea, our computer vision can detect faces within your field of vision from a mile away as well as other Pea users from a greater distance, and get you on a different, better path ASAP! This spares you the awkward conversation and lets you save face when you just don’t feel like dealing with someone that day!
