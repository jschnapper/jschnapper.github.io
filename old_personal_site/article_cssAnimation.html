				<p>
					For programming, this assignment goes over key positioning methods and reinforces basic box-model terminology and techniques. Additionally, this assignment allowed students to practice concepts from previous lectures, such as using html tags and pseudo-selectors. For design, this assignment goes over font and color choices.
				</p>
				<p>Key Lessons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The differences between <code>absolute</code>, <code>relative</code>, and <code>fixed</code> positioning
					</li>
					<li>
						How to add background images and html image
					</li>
					<li>
						Using <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="article-header">Failures</div>
			<p>
				A discussion of teachable moments and how to improve
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The assignment was way too long and many students were not able to make it the checkpoint. We only have 1 hour for the assignment, so rather than cram a bunch of material in, focus on the necessary lessons of the week and how to implement them
				</li>
				<li>
					Because of how crucial and difficult positioning is to learn for beginners, it would be more beneficial to come up with simpe demonstrations of the relationship between the different methods
				</li>
				<li>
					Definitely make shorter activities
				</li>
			</ul>
