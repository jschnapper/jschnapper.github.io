			<p>
				For programming, this assignment goes over key positioning methods and reinforces basic box-model terminology and techniques. Additionally, this assignment allows students to practice concepts from previous lectures, such as using html tags and pseudo-selectors. For design, this assignment goes over font and color choices. 
			</p>
			<p>Key Lessons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The differences between <code>absolute</code>, <code>relative</code>, and <code>fixed</code> positioning
				</li>
				<li>
					How to add background images and html image 
				</li>
				<li>
					Using <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="article-header">Failures</div>
			<p>
				A discussion of teachable moments and how to improve
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The assignment was way too long and many students were not able to make it the checkpoint. We only have 1 hour for the assignment, so rather than cram a bunch of material in, focus on the necessary lessons of the week and how to implement the material
				</li>
				<li>
					Because of how crucial and difficult positioning is to learn for beginners, it would be more beneficial to come up with simple demonstrations of the relationship between the different methods
				</li>
				<li>
					Definitely make shorter activities
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="article-header">Successes</div>
			<p>
				A discussion of what went well
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Despite the fact that it was too long, it was one of the most memorable in-class lab assignments (by class survey). When making assignments, give them some sort of theme and fun qualities so it isn't boring or stressful for people who are new to programming.
